## Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct Run (Recommended)
```bash
python supply_chain_app.py
```

### Option 2: Using Launcher
```bash
python run_app.py
```

The application will automatically:
1. Check for required dependencies
2. Install missing packages
3. Generate synthetic supply chain data
4. Launch the Streamlit dashboard at http://localhost:8501

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Forecasting**: Prophet, Statsmodels (ARIMA)
- **Analytics**: Scikit-learn

## Key Metrics Calculated

### Inventory KPIs
- **Inventory Turnover**: Cost of Goods Sold Ã· Average Inventory
- **Stockout Rate**: Percentage of days with stockouts
- **Service Level**: Probability of not stocking out (85%-99.9%)
- **Carrying Cost**: Cost of holding inventory

### Reorder Calculations
- **Reorder Point (ROP)**: Demand during Lead Time + Safety Stock
- **Safety Stock**: Buffer inventory for demand variability (service-level driven)
- **Service Level Scenarios**: Multi-level analysis with cost trade-offs
- **Optimal Service Level**: Cost-minimizing service level calculation

### Supplier Metrics
- **Delivery Performance**: On-time delivery percentage
- **Lead Time Variability**: Consistency in delivery times
- **Quality Score**: Overall supplier performance rating

### Financial Metrics
- **Carrying Cost per Unit**: Daily holding cost calculation
- **Lost Sales Impact**: Revenue loss from stockouts
- **Margin Loss**: Profit impact from delays and variability
- **Inventory ROI**: Return on inventory investment
- **Total Cost Impact**: Comprehensive financial analysis

### Inventory Thresholds
- **Maximum Inventory**: Upper limit (30 days demand)
- **Minimum Inventory**: Lower limit (5 days demand)
- **Reorder Point**: Trigger level with safety buffer
- **Threshold Utilization**: Current vs maximum capacity
- **Violation Tracking**: Days exceeding limits

## Data Structure

The application generates enhanced realistic synthetic data including:
- Product information (ID, category, supplier)
- Daily demand patterns with seasonality and weekly cycles
- Inventory levels with realistic restocking logic
- Inventory thresholds (max, min, reorder points)
- Enhanced stockout scenarios (25% more realistic)
- Supplier performance with variable delays (25% chance)
- Cost and pricing data with profit margins
- Financial impact calculations
- Threshold violation tracking

## Business Value

This analytics platform demonstrates:
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast future demand patterns
- **Optimization**: Minimize inventory costs while maintaining service levels
- **Risk Management**: Identify potential stockouts and supply disruptions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track supplier and inventory KPIs
- **Decision Support**: Data-driven recommendations for inventory management

## Portfolio Highlights

- Real-world business problem solving
- Advanced time series forecasting
- Interactive dashboard development
- Supply chain domain expertise
- End-to-end analytics pipeline
- Professional data visualization

## Requirements
